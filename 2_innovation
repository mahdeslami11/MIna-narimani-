We proposed soft speech units to improve unsupervised voice
conversion. We showed that soft units are a good middle ground between discrete and continuous features â€“ they accurately represent linguistic content while still discarding speaker
information. In both objective and subjective evaluations, we
found that soft units improve intelligibility and naturalness.
Future work will investigate soft speech units for any-to-any
voice conversion.
